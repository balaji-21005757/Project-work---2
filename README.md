# Fake News Detection System

## Project Description

The Fake News Detection System is a machine learning-based solution designed to identify and classify news articles as real or fake. This system helps combat misinformation by analyzing textual content using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Learning techniques. It provides an efficient way to verify news credibility, ensuring a more reliable information ecosystem.

## Features

‚úÖ Advanced Machine Learning Models ‚Äì Uses deep learning models like CNN, LSTM, and Transformers.

‚úÖ Real-time News Classification ‚Äì Quickly determines whether an article is fake or real.

‚úÖ Natural Language Processing (NLP) ‚Äì Includes text tokenization, stemming, stop-word removal, and TF-IDF vectorization.

‚úÖ Scalability ‚Äì Supports large datasets for training and prediction.

‚úÖ User-Friendly Interface ‚Äì Can be integrated into a web or mobile application.

## Tech Stack

## System Architecture

1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Collection - Collects real and fake news datasets  

2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preprocessing - Cleans text (removes stop words, stemming, tokenization)  

3Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Extraction - Uses TF-IDF and word embeddings  

4Ô∏è‚É£ Model Training - Trains using CNN/LSTM/BERT models  

5Ô∏è‚É£ Fake News Classification - Predicts if news is real or fake  

6Ô∏è‚É£ Evaluation - Analyzes accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
